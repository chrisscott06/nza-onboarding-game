## Purpose

The NZA Onboarding Game — a deliberately silly 2D platformer (Super Mario, but
the baddies are gas boilers, ICE cars and oil slicks; the collectibles are
renewables; the power-up is an air-source heat pump). The game is bait: its real
job is to teach two new starters (Will and Imi) the exact NZA way of building
software with AI agents — clone, work to a contract, create and store assets,
commit in stages, branch, push, open a PR, deploy, and verify on a real device.

This repo currently builds **only the foundation (Level 0)**: the engine, the
face system, the branding, and the level contract that lets others drop in their
own levels. See `BRIEF.md` for the full specification and the STOP-AND-PROVE
gates for each Part.

## Current state

- Repo cloned and initialised. `BRIEF.md` landed.
- **Part A done and verified.** A vanilla HTML5 canvas engine (no framework, no
  build tool) renders a character that runs left/right, jumps with a deliberate
  Mario feel (acceleration/friction, variable-height jump, coyote-time,
  jump-buffering), and lands on platforms. A side-scrolling camera follows it.
  Keyboard controls work (← → / A D move, Space / ↑ / W jump).
  - Verified in a real browser: character ran to top speed, jumped (went
    airborne), and landed back on the ground (`onGround` true); camera scrolled.
    Screenshot confirmed the character, platforms and camera render correctly.
- `README.md` (how to run locally) and `CREDITS.md` (engine provenance) added.
- **Part B done and verified.** Collision outcomes added:
  - Touching a **hazard** (gas boiler, ☠) resets the run — player back to start,
    score zeroed, collectibles restored.
  - Touching a **collectible** (solar panel, ✦) adds points and removes it.
  - A **SCORE** readout is drawn in screen space (monospace, top-left).
  - Verified in a real browser: collectibles accumulated 100 → 200 → 300;
    hazard reset the run (score 0, player at start, collectibles back); HUD and
    object art confirmed on screen via screenshot.
- **Part C done and verified.** The level contract is live:
  - `data/objects.json` — the SHARED table (id, type, sprite, points) for gas
    boiler / ICE car / oil slick / solar panel / wind turbine / heat pump.
  - `levels/level-chris/level.json` — platforms, placements (objectId + x,y),
    startPosition, goal. `meta.json` — name, author, theme, faceAsset,
    accentColor. Plus a placeholder `assets/face-chris.svg`.
  - `levels/_template-level/` — documented stub `level.json` + `meta.json`
    (every field explained via `_doc_*` comment-strings the engine ignores) and
    an empty `assets/.gitkeep`. This is the contract Will and Imi copy.
  - `src/game.js` now READS the JSON and resolves placements against the object
    table; the engine has zero hardcoded level content. Object sprites are
    loaded from the paths in `objects.json` (with a placeholder fallback).
  - Real shared sprites added under `public/sprites/` (SVG).
  - Verified in a real browser: engine loaded the level from JSON (9 platforms,
    5 placements, goal); sprites rendered; moving a platform in `level.json`
    visibly relocated it with NO code change, then reverted cleanly.
- No faces rendered on the character, no branding, no power-up yet.

## Next

- **Part D** — Prove the contract: add a second level (`levels/level-test/`) by
  copying the template and changing only data + a placeholder asset, plus a
  level picker on `index.html`. Both levels playable with ZERO engine-code
  edits. Verify in-browser, commit.

(Build order: A → B → C → D → E → F → G → H → I. Each Part has a STOP-AND-PROVE
gate in `BRIEF.md §6`. Nothing is "done" until verified working in a real
browser / on a real phone.)
